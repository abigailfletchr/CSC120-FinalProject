# CSC120-FinalProject

### Design Justification

I am an Education major and really love the childhood developmental stages, I think that stuff is so interesting. Based on my major, interests, and the prompt of this project I immediately thought of a 'life' or 'Sims' like game that took the user through the stages of life. I at first aimed really hard in trying to have a lot more stages than just infancy, but I successfully narrowed it down. At first, an alternative I thought of was having the user be the mom or parent and they had to raise a baby. However, I had a hard time thinking of challenges or a way to make it game-like. Therefore, I was like 'Oh, maybe they can be the BABY'. I think that because I connected this game to my major and interests there was a deeper backgrounf knowledge and I was able to make the game fun because I love the content!
  
## Reflection Questions

 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?
 I really tried to work on the project bit by bit. I had to be really diligent with completing it and sometimes I lacked that. However, completing the architecuture diagrams really helped because it let me break down each class and see exactly what the class needed. Aside from the 'formal' architecture diagram it really helped to write out and describe the game before I even started to code. When I did start coding I just tried not to freak out, took it slowly, and got help when needed!

 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
 I really learned how to get ASCII art into my project and when I would copy & paste it would mess up so I had to work with that formatting. Then, I really had to figure out/sort out my understanding of hashtables because I used one to track the amount of times the user attempted the challenge. Something else was really understanding Scanner and making the input secure and work well. Some nuance things was String input vs. int input & when I was using lots of different inputs it kept remembering previous inputs, so I learned about buffering and how to work with that. Also, I figured out that you can copy & paste emojis into your code and I had to look up how to make text italicized in code. Lastly, I would say it was kinda hard in the loops and if else statements to get the 'logic' right. I kept having a ton of logic errors and nothing would successfuly run. Oh! and, remembering what methods apply to Strings or ints, like .equals() (String only)

 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?
 I feel like I could have created methods for some of the banners and lines I used to seperate scenes in the game instead of just repeatedly printing a ton of lines of code. It is a bit messy because I was working with a lot of just text. Overall, I think it could have been more efficient and concise. Compared to my homeworks I definitely saw that difference but it was hard to not get wordy when habing to make and desgin the game all by myself without pretty in depth instructions.

 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?
 I wish I could have made the inputs more flexible and had more in depth checking of the inputs. Like, if the user made a spelling error but the game still recognized their response. In some cases I just created an arraylist and had the user pick a number instead of having to check every piece of input.

 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you? My girlfriend suggested that I really scale back on my idea. When I first started out I wanted to implement 2 to 3 stages of my own but she saw how time consuming and hard that would have been and suggested I stick with just infancy and really 'perfecting' that stage (i tried my best). Also, when I kept having my logic errors in the game method in the Game class she helped me think about the logic.

 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give? I would hint at myself to **USE MY TIME WISELY AND START MUCH EARLIER**. I had enough time and did not feel too rushed but I definitely did not use my time the most wisely and felt a lot of pressure tpward the end. There was just A LOT to think about when creating your own game and that thinking was really sped up. Also, to pay a little bit more attention to the lectures at the end of the semester.
