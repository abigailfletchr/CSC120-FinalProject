**Start of Game**
1. the game begins and you have to answer the prompts which are choosing attributes for your baby.
2. the game displays these attributes and the statistics of your baby.

**Entering the Challenges**
1. you are asked if you want to try to work on motor skills, trust & connection skills, or your speech skills.
2. if you choose motor skills you are then asked to decide between two challenges: picking your head up OR crawling.

**Motor Skills Challenges**
1. your options are: picking your head up OR crawling.
2. if you choose the crawling challenge you are asked to input/guess a room that 'your stuffed animal is in'. you are given two chances to guess.
3. if you choose the picking your head up challenge you are asked to input/guess a number. the computer randomly generates a number and you win points based on if your guess is close to the randomly generated computer number.

**Trust & Connection Challenges**
1. you only have one option: the sign language challenge.
2. in the sign language challenge you are randomly assigned a need. then, the sign language descriptions are displayed to you. you then have to guess/input what sign language description matches with the need you are given. you are given two chances to guess. you win points if you guess correctly.

**Speech Skills Challenges**
1. you only have one option: the babble challenge.
2. in the babble challenge you are told that your parent is in front of you. you are then asked to babble the correct sounds that align with what parent is in front of you. if you are correct that is successful babbling and you win points. you are given two chances.

**End of Game**
1. the game ends after you complete each challenge twice OR after you acheive 17 points across the three categories.
2. if you get 17 points, the game ends and you are given a kindergarten readiness description based on the amount of points you acheived in each of the categories. if you got less than 5 points in a given category you get a pessimistic description.
3. if you have completed all of four challenges twice, but did not get 17 points, you failed infancy and do not get to go to kindergarten.
